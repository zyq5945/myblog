Do you think this improved Internet user experience can change the world?
===========================================================================


I. Internet problems
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Our current life and study have become increasingly inseparable from the Internet. In the process of using the Internet, there are some doubts:

1. What is wrong with the existing Internet support against voting? !
2. Is there any good way to fix the problem? !
3. What is the improved user experience after fixing this issue? !


II. The dilemma of information dissemination
-------------------------------------------------------------------
In the Internet, we need to read and understand information on our own, spend a lot of time and energy, we can know the value of information, and sometimes we can't judge the value of information with our own ability.

1. Some movie and TV dramas cost money to buy water army and data mislead us, but some aspects of plot, picture, special effects and so on do garbage, not only waste time and money, but also disgusting you. The plot, the picture, the special effects, etc. all have unique weights in each person's heart. Individuals cannot find the companion that can resonate with them, and cannot easily come together.

2. Looking for cost-effective mobile phone information, most of them can only find useful information from the search for the Shui Shui Army information. Because there is no professional knowledge of mobile phones, they can not judge the authenticity of the information.

3. I want to find a professional doctor when I have nowhere to seek medical attention. But the Internet is full of many non-professional doctors' fraud information. We can't effectively distinguish those that are true. We always have to experience it ourselves to know the authenticity. Time is not only wasting our time, energy and money are not said, but also delaying treatment

4. Some people have a disease that can't be cured by modern medicine (can be tried repeatedly), but doctors may recommend expensive medicines for their own benefit. Good patients give their answers through bold comparisons, compared to patients who are ignorant of unknowns. This is a relatively professional and useful information. It is clear that the patient is slightly better, but this information can be easily overwhelmed by many spam or misunderstood as medical advertising information.

In the hobby recommendation platform, most of them use anonymous voting, one vote per person, no recommendation level division, and cannot express the degree that each person wants to recommend personally. Therefore, there is no data on the degree of personal recommendation of others, and it is impossible to infer whether or not they can resonate with themselves in terms of interest preferences. Only then will the sensibility of the whispering experts be difficult to find, and it is not easy to come together and cannot effectively share each other. Information, you have to spend your time and energy to find and try.

The existing AI recommendation platform uses complex algorithms, and through the historical information of personal reading, it can only make rough recommendations, and it is impossible to accurately recommend information that is easy to resonate. Tucao recommended part of the reason why UP is popular, which not only avoids wasting time on the number of things that are not on the list, but also saves us the cost of finding information of interest.

For example, in Han Yu's "Shi Shuo", "there are times in the news, and the surgery has a specialization." The truth that we all hear will be first and foremost, and there will be professional and unprofessional in some fields. We do not form professional information and experience complement each other, which also leads to being more prone to be fooled by the fraud of some speculators.

When we are involved in new fields, it is also because the platform is an anonymous recommendation. There is no professional recommendation level data. It is impossible to infer whether a person is professional or not, and it is impossible to effectively find a professional and reliable expert to obtain it in related fields. The professional knowledge and experience must be based on unprofessional knowledge and experience, and spend a lot of time and effort to find. Even professional experts who want to improve their professionalism in related fields need to find useful professional information from a huge amount of information. They do not directly and efficiently obtain professional knowledge and experience from many professional peer experts.

The knowledge and experience summarized by the people who walked in front did not have a good way to pass it down. They also had to spend a lot of time, energy, money, etc. to find them. The effectiveness was low, not professional, and unprofessional led to many problem.


III. Reasons for the formation of the dilemma
-------------------------------------------------------------------
In the anti-voting function of the Internet, the current practice is based on the head of the person, but the difference between the stranger and the trusted expert is very large. We ignore this difference.

Each piece of information has its own unique vocalist (ie user account or organization that publishes information). As a vocalist, they all have vocal weights. Some words can be ignored like a fart. Some words have a reference value and can be listened to. We should not ignore this very important attribute.

The pros and cons are divided by percentage. 100% and 10% of the willingness to express are two completely different concepts. The degree of division is not included in the Internet, and the unsigned and varying degrees of approval are put into a black box, so that it has lost a great degree of reference value, which is not what we want.

Ignoring the vocal weight attribute of the vocalist, the information is extremely vulnerable to the spam of the squadron, and it may take time and effort to find information that needs to be read. Individuals who do not make information are personalized, recommended, and disagreed, so that they are all combined and do not show the willingness of the user to express themselves. The unprofessionality of the Internet in these two aspects makes it impossible for us to quickly find valuable information. The information of the people who walked in front of us has lost the vast amount of reference value and cannot be used as a reference for later people.


IV. The wonderful properties of information
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Using trust levels to represent vocal weights, we now attach the following fantastic attributes to each message:

1. The level of trust of the information utterer: Identify the reliability of this information. This attribute can even be seen at a glance whether it is an expert, is it a new person, is not a malicious predecessor, etc.

2. The level of recommendation of the information utterer: the professional recognition of the information by the vocalist

3. The degree of trust and approval of many other information vocalists: Multi-person personalization of the professional recognition of this information, this attribute can greatly improve the professional fault tolerance of information. When the reliability of the information is not very reliable (that is, the information utterer is a new person, malicious or evil expert or non-senior expert), or the information is more important to increase the reliability, the key analysis, especially the degree of approval of the experts , can get its professional recognition

These three wonderful attributes are positively related to the professionalism of the information:

1. According to the degree of trust and recommendation attached to it, it is already known about the professional recognition of information.

2. When a person whose information is trusted by a different degree is in favor of evaluation, we will give priority to the reference with a higher degree of trust. Only when the reference is insufficient, will the degree of trust be considered low.

3. Those who have provided us with spam for their own personal gains have completely destroyed the trust relationship, and can ignore the information they provide from now on, effectively avoiding being defrauded again. Even if it may provide very valuable information in the future, ignoring will make us not see it for the first time, but it will also be trusted by experts with higher trust relationships, and ultimately we know

4. The information of a highly trusted expert can eliminate a lot of low-reliability water army spam

5. In the more extreme cases, when a piece of information is 100% approved by a professional and trusted expert, we can even ignore the evaluation of other people's approval and opposition to their information. After reading the information, it is very likely that it will also be Vote for a high degree of approval

Now when a piece of information is presented to us, we can know the professionalism of the information through the wonderful attributes without reading the information. After reading the information, follow the professional guidelines and use a smaller amount of time and energy. Professional verification of information can be done.

Because we don't need to read the information, we already know the professionalism of the information, which makes us more professional in finding professional information. The time and energy consumed will be very little. The knowledge and experience summarized by the predecessors will be well passed down.

It is no longer necessary to look up the professionalism of the verification information from the searched information ocean, and it is still time-consuming and laborious to repeat the process. The efforts of the predecessors have not been passed down.


V. How to build a trust relationship
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Unlike in real life, the Internet is a lot of people who are unfamiliar and don't know. How do we build a trust record file for others?

You can view the historical information of its propagation, and manually set the corresponding reliability based on experience, also known as credit weight. The higher the credit weight, the more valuable the information he provides, and we can reward him with feedback and improve his creditworthiness at the right time. The lower the credit weight, the less valuable the information he provides, and we can isolate and punish him and feedback to reduce its credit weight in a timely manner.

The more historical information he disseminates, the more valuable he is, and the higher his reputation weight.

Sometimes you don't need to look at all of its historical information. Just look at the most controversial pieces of information and find out that you can verify its professionalism, and you can roughly infer its credit weight.

If you are not particularly interested in the timeliness and scope of information, you only need to pay attention to a few of the trusted experts to get a lot of professional information in related fields. These many professional information are experts with their own knowledge and experience, have been professionally recommended to deal with, and even have reasons, basis, proof, guarantee and so on.

Only experts need to specifically pursue the timeliness and scope of information. Because they are not professional, they may not be able to judge the professionalism of information. First, they can only pay attention to the development of information.

Now when we enter a new field, we can find a way to find one of the most reliable experts. Because they are professional in this field, they can know that those people are professional and those who are not professional. After obtaining the authorization of its authorization, copy the credit value data set for others in the field, so that we immediately have a professional perspective in the field, relying on its shoulders and following the guidance of its valuable experience. With less time and effort, you can complete the value verification of professional information and solve many problems caused by personal unprofessional. Even professional experts can directly obtain information that they have not yet known, but have been verified by other experts for their professionalism.


VI. Professional cause and effect
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Because of the professional, it is more able to distinguish the professional level of information, so that it has a higher credit value in the relevant field, and the information sent will be more worthy of reference. Of course, you can also be unprofessional because of the interest problem, and the high tolerance of the wonderful attributes of information leads to the impression that you are not very professional, and lower your own credit in the relevant field, so that you can not easily build a large number of Professional followers will turn to find a more professional, higher reputation, and more professional information.

Anyone who thinks about unprofessional information in related fields will be unlikely to attempt fraudulent deception, as it will be recognized and exposed by senior professionals. The professional information released by newcomers will be recognized by professionals because they are professional and will be identified to the professional level and recommended to others.

Some people try to pretend to be experts, and by subscribing to the professional information of senior experts, they slowly mix the credits with the effect of the East, but as long as they dare to publish non-professional information for fraud, they will soon be prototyped by professional experts. In fact, such counterfeit experts are also very well-recognized. Because they do not have relevant professional knowledge, they cannot make their own professional judgments on information in the first time. They can only sip behind the expert buttocks and find out that they have such obvious characteristics. Pretending to be an expert.


VII. Promote the development of the platform
-------------------------------------------------------------------
There are precedents for customers to pay for professional information from the store. They pay for professionalism and efficiency. The platform introduces a payment mechanism. Users pay directly to enjoy the knowledge and experience that professionals have already summarized. The knowledge and experience of professionals can be sold to more. Users with more needs, after all, experts also need to take money to eat.

In the past, because there was no individualized distinction between individuals, the knowledge and experience of professionals could not be well passed down, and the results of their professional efforts were not rewarded accordingly, which made them lack the motivation to do professional things. The platform needs to encourage and reward professionals (or organizations) to do professional things, so that when people mention the professionalism of a certain field, they think of this platform, attract more and more people to join and then do more professional things, thus forming a platform. A virtuous cycle develops.

The platform needs to be more convenient for newcomers to enter the relevant fields, so that they can find more professional and reliable experts to integrate them into this new field and get the professional information they need. Provide multi-professional perspective switching and analysis, and a more intuitive user experience, making it easier for users to infer the professionalism of information.

Even when the platform has a professional reputation, let the user directly tell the platform that the unique weight and qualification conditions of the professional information that he wants (the platform needs unique weight of recommendation degree information), and the platform directly recommends the professional experts to the user.

Concerned about unprofessionals, they may encounter unprofessional information fraud on the platform, and introduce certain reward and punishment mechanisms in certain areas to ensure the professionalism of information and promote the more efficient dissemination of professional information.


VIII. Initial development of the platform
-------------------------------------------------------------------
The platform uses the guaranteed reward and punishment mechanism to ensure the professionalism of information in certain fields. The main goal is to attract users and create a professional reputation of their own platform, so that users can be willing to pay for professional and efficient, and obtain the latest professional information of professional experts.

I want to use the platform to roughly distinguish between two types of people, professional and unprofessional.

At the beginning of the platform, people with professional recognition ability will be friendly. For example, in terms of hobbies and interests, each of us is the most professional expert in our own interest preferences, and has the ability to judge and verify its professionalism. Through the platform based on the historical information of the degree of recommendation of others, it is easy to find a companion that resonates with oneself, and the professional level of it is also clear. In this way, we will pay attention to a number of companion experts and obtain information that we have not yet known but have made recommendations. After interpreting according to the priority, we can have directional information such as news, movies, TV series, anime, and novels. Etc., and these are all interest-priority content that has been prioritized and easily resonated with oneself. Many companion experts have strongly recommended the same content and greatly increase their fault tolerance.

For non-professionals, it is because they are not professional, so they want to find a professional, but because they are not professional, they may not be able to distinguish those who are professional, those who are not professional, will easily fall into a vicious circle. The platform provides a reward and punishment mechanism to ensure the professionalism of information, making users who are in urgent need of professional information more willing to use the platform to obtain professional information.


IX. Advantages of the platform
-------------------------------------------------------------------
The platform introduces a reward and punishment mechanism in certain professional fields. The high punishment makes the users lose their profits, and does not dare to publish unprofessional information easily, ensuring that the professionalism of the information will be stronger, making the people who urgently need professional information more confident and secure. Use the new platform to get professional information.

The existing old platform can't block those disgusting malicious spammers, even if they know that they are unprofessional, they have to endure their spam every day. The new platform will revolutionize this situation, making users more willing to use the new platform to access information.

The new platform will be more in line with the user experience, users use the way of inheritance to obtain professional information, greatly reducing the consumption of users to find and verify professional information (time, energy, money, etc.). Not only can professional people solve many problems of unprofessionals, professional information circulation and acquisition between professionals is faster, and in terms of hobbies, users can easily find the companion that resonates with their interest preferences, and come together better. . The overall communication of all professional information is more professional and more efficient.
