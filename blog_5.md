The most problematic user experience in the history of the Internet
==================================================================

### [*This article is a translation of the Chinese version using Bing and Google*](.) 

I. The problems of the Internet
------------------------------------------------------------------
We are now living and learning more and more inseparable from the internet, in the use of the internet process, there will be some questions:

1. What is the problem with the existing internet pro-voting function?!
2. Is there any good way to fix the problem?!
3. What is the enhanced user experience after fixing the problem?!


II. The plight of information dissemination
------------------------------------------------------------------
In the internet, we need to read through the understanding of information, spend a lot of time and energy to know the value of information, and even sometimes with their own ability, can not judge the value of information situation. 

1. Some film dramas spend money to buy the navy and the data mislead us, but the plot, the picture, the special effects and so on some aspects to do the rubbish, not only wasting time and money not to say, also disgusting you.The plot, the picture, the special effects and so on each person's heart has the unique weight, the individual cannot be very good to find with can resonate with the bosom friend, cannot more easily come together

2. Find the most cost-effective mobile phone information, most of them can only search for the vast navy information to find useful information, because there is no cell phone expertise, they can not judge the authenticity of information

3. When looking for a doctor without a door in the local, but the online flooded with a lot of non-professional doctors fraud information, we can not effectively distinguish those are true, always have to experience to know the authenticity, sometimes not only waste our time, energy and money do not say, but also delayed the treatment 

4. Some people have the incurable disease of modern medicine (can be repeated trial medicine), but the doctor may recommend expensive drugs for their own benefit, good patients through bold contrast to give their own answers, compared to ignorant patients, which is relatively more professional useful information, patients slightly better than the right is clear,but this information can be easily drowned out by a lot of spam, or misunderstood as a medical advertising message. 

In the interests of the recommendation platform, most of the use of the anonymous vote, one vote per person, there is no recommended level division, can not express each individual want to recommend the degree.Therefore, no one else personalized recommendation degree data, can not be inferred in the interests of their preferences and their own resonance, will have a bosom friend experts difficult to find feelings, it is not too easy to come together, can not effectively share information between each other, but also to spend their time and energy to find and try. 

The existing AI recommendation platform uses sophisticated algorithms, through the history of personal reading, can only be rough recommendations, but also can not be accurately recommended to resonate with the information.

Each of us heard the truth will have first, in some areas will have professional and unprofessional.We do not have the expertise and experience to complement each other, which also leads to a lack of professionalism that can be more easily fooled by the fraud of certain speculators. 

When we are involved in the new field, but also because the platform is anonymous recommendation, no one else's professional recommendation of the degree of data, can not infer whether a person is professional, can not effectively find professional and reliable experts, access to their relevant fields of expertise and experience, must have their own professional knowledge and experience, It takes a lot of time and effort to find out.Even professional experts want to improve their expertise in the relevant fields, but also need to find useful professional information from a huge amount of information, not directly and efficiently from a number of professional peer experts to obtain their unknown expertise and experience.

The knowledge and experience summarized by the people who walked in front did not have a good way to pass it down. Each of us has to spend a lot of time, energy, money, etc. to find them. The effectiveness was low, not professional, and unprofessional led to many problem.


III. Causes of difficulties
------------------------------------------------------------------
In the internet's pro-voting function, The current practice is in the head count, but the difference between a stranger and a trusted expert in favour of voting is very large, and we ignore this distinction.

Each piece of information has its own only voice (that is the user account or the organization of the release of information), as the voice of all have voice weights, some talk like fart can ignore not listen, some talk more reference value can focus on listening, we should not ignore this very important attribute.

The pros and cons are divided by percentage. 100% and 10% of the willingness to express are two completely different concepts. We have not included the degree of division in the internet, putting unsigned and different levels of approval into a black box, so that it has lost a great degree of reference value, this is not what we want.

We ignore the vocal weight attribute of the vocalist, which makes the information extremely vulnerable to the spam of the squadron. It may take time and effort to find information that needs to be read. The level division of personal recommendation, approval, opposition, etc. of users information makes them all together, and does not show the willingness of users to express themselves. The unprofessionality of the internet in these two aspects makes it impossible for us to quickly find valuable information. The information of the people who walked in front of us has lost the vast amount of reference value and cannot be used as a reference for later people.


IV. Wonderful attributes of information
------------------------------------------------------------------  
Using the confidence level to represent the sounding weights, now we have the following wonderful attributes attached to each message:

1. The confidence level of the information sounder: identify the reliability of this information, this attribute can even be seen at a glance is an expert, or a new person, or a person who has malicious criminal record, etc.

2. The degree of recommendation of the information speaker: the professional recognition of this information by the information sounder 

3. The degree of trust and approval of many other information speakers: multiple personalization of the professional recognition of this information, this attribute can greatly improve the professional fault rate of information.When the reliability of the information is not very strong (that is, The information is the new person, malicious perpetrators or non-senior experts), or information is more important to increase reliability, the focus of its analysis, especially the pro-objection degree of experts, can be obtained its professional recognition degree

These three wonderful attributes are positively correlated with the professional nature of information:

1. Depending on the degree of trust and recommendation, it is known that the professional accreditation of information

2. When a piece of information is approved by a person with a different degree of trust, we will give priority to the reference with a higher degree of trust. Only when the reference is insufficient, we will consider the less trustworthy 

3. Those who have provided spam to defraud us for their own personal gain have completely undermined the trust relationship and we can ignore the information they provide from now on, effectively avoiding fraud again.Even if it is possible to provide valuable information in the future, ignoring will not be the first time we see it, but we will also be trusted by high-level experts to give the value of information to the affirmation, and ultimately we know

4. A high degree of reliance on the information of experts, can eliminate many of the low level of trust of the navy garbage information

5. In the more extreme cases, when a piece of information is supported by a professional and trusted expert 100%, we can even ignore other people's evaluation of their support and opposition to the information, which is very likely to be highly favored after reading through the information.

Now when a message is presented in front of us, in the case of not reading through the information, through the wonderful attributes to know the professionalism of the information, after reading through the information, follow the professional guidance, use a little more time and energy, also can complete the professional verification of information.

Because we do not need to read through the information to know the professionalism of the information, so that we find professional information more professional, the time and energy consumption will be very little, the previous summary of knowledge and experience will be well passed down.

There is no need to look for the expertise of verification information from the vast ocean of searching information, and it was time for everyone to repeat the process, and the results of previous efforts have not been passed down.


V. How to build a trust relationship
------------------------------------------------------------------
Unlike in real life, the internet is a lot of unfamiliar and do not know people, how do we establish the trust of other people record files? 

You can view historical information about his spread, and manually set the appropriate trust for he based on experience, also known as the credit weight. The higher the weight of the credit, the more valuable the information he provides, and we can reward him with feedback in time to improve his credit weight.The lower the weight of the credit, the less valuable the information he provides, and we can isolate and punish him and the feedback at the right time to reduce his credit weight.

The more historical information he spreads, the more valuable he is, and the higher his credit weight will be.

Sometimes we don't need to look at all of his historical information. Just look at some of his most controversial information and find out that you can verify its professionalism, and then roughly infer his credit weight.

If the timeliness and scope of the information is not particularly pursued, it is only a matter of focusing on one of the few trusted experts who will be able to obtain professional information in the relevant fields.These many professional information are experts with their own knowledge and experience, has done a professional degree of recommendation in favor of treatment, and even have reason, basis, proof, guarantee and so on.

Only experts need to specifically pursue the timeliness and scope of information, because not professional, may not be able to judge the professionalism of information, first see also can only focus on the development of information.

Now when we get into a new field, find out one of the trusted experts who are professional in this field and know that those people are professional and those who are unprofessional. After obtaining his authorization permission, copy the credit weight data that he has set for others in this area, so that we have a professional perspective in this field, relying on his shoulders, guided by his valuable experience, using less time and effort, to complete the value of professional information verification, solve many problems caused by personal unprofessional.Even professional experts can obtain information directly from other experts that they have not yet known, but have been verified by other experts for their professionalism.


VI. Professional cause and effect
------------------------------------------------------------------ 
Because of the professional, so more able to distinguish the professional degree of information, making it in the relevant fields have a higher value of credit, the information sent will be more worthy of reference. Of course, you can also because of the interests of the problem is not professional, the wonderful nature of the information brought by the high fault tolerance, resulting in their own impression is not too professional, reduce their reputation in the relevant areas of the right value, making you finally set up a large number of non-professional followers, will go to find a more professional than you, the credibility of the professional information is more worthy of reference. 

It is impossible for anyone to think of an unprofessional message in the relevant field, as it will be recognized and exposed by experienced professionals.The professional information released by the newcomer will be recognized by the professional and identified as a professional recommendation to other people's eyes.

Someone attempt to impersonate an expert, by subscribing to the professional information of senior experts, to slowly promote credit weights in a parody way, but as long as they dare to publish non-professional information for fraud, will immediately be revealed the prototype of their cheats by professional experts. In fact, this kind of pseudo-experts are also very good recognition, because there is no relevant expertise, can not be the first time to make their own professional judgment on information, only with the experts behind the butt yell, find the following have such obvious characteristics is impersonating experts.


VII. Promoting the development of the platform
------------------------------------------------------------------
Ancient guests to bartender paid to pay for professional information precedent, pay to buy professional and efficient, the platform to introduce pay mechanism, the user paid directly to enjoy the knowledge and experience that the professionals have summed up, the knowledge and experience of professionals can be sold more to the needs of users, after all, experts need to take money to eat.

In the past, because there is no individual difference, the knowledge and experience of professionals can not be passed very well, the results of their professional efforts will not be rewarded, making it lack of motivation to do professional things.The platform needs to encourage and reward professionals (or organizations) to do professional things, so that when people mention the professionalism of a field to think of this platform, attracting more and more people to become more professional after the event, thus forming a benign cycle of platform development.

The platform needs to make it easier for newcomers to come into the field to find a very professional and reliable expert to quickly incorporate into this new field and get the professional information they need.Provide multi-professional view switching and analysis, more intuitive aspects of user experience, so that users more convenient to infer the professionalism of information.

Even when the platform to play a professional reputation, so that users directly tell the platform, the professional information they want the unique weight and qualification (platform needs to have a unique weight of the recommended degree of information), the platform directly to the user recommended professional experts.

For those who are not professional, they may encounter unprofessional information fraud on the platform, introduce certain incentive and reward mechanism in some areas to ensure the professionalism of information, and promote the dissemination of professional information more efficiently.


VIII. Initial development of the platform
------------------------------------------------------------------
Platform use to ensure that the reward and punishment mechanism to ensure the professionalism of certain areas of information, the main goal is to attract users, to create their own platform professional reputation, in order to enable users willing to pay for professional and efficient, access to professional experts the latest professional information.

There are two types of people who want to use the platform broadly, professional and unprofessional. 

At the beginning of the platform for professionals with professional identification ability to better friends, such as in the interests of hobbies, each of us are their own interests of the most professional experts, have a professional judgment of their ability to verify. It is easy to find a bosom friend who resonates with yourself through the platform according to the historical information of other people's recommendation, and it is also clear to the degree of his professionalism. In this way, attention to a number of bosom experts, to obtain their own not yet known but it does recommend the degree of information, according to the priority of the interpretation, you can have the direction of the news, movies, TV dramas, animation, novels, etc., and these are to do a priority division, easy to arouse their sympathy interest preferences content,many phoenixmiles experts have strongly recommended the same content and greatly increase their fault tolerance.

For the non-professional, it is because it is not professional, so just want to find professional, but also because of unprofessional, may not be able to distinguish those who are professional, those are not professional, will easily into a vicious circle. The platform provides a guarantee and rewards mechanism to ensure the professionalism of information, making the urgent need for professional information users, more willing to use the platform, to obtain professional information.


IX. Advantages of the platform
------------------------------------------------------------------
The platform uses the guaranteed reward and punishment mechanism to ensure the professionalism of information in certain fields. The main goal is to attract users and create a professional reputation of their own platform, so that users can be willing to pay for professional and efficient, and obtain the latest professional information of professional experts. .

The new platform will radically change this situation, making users more willing to use the new platform to get information.

The new platform will be more in line with the user experience, users use the way of inheritance to obtain professional information, greatly reducing the consumption of users to find and verify professional information (time, energy, money, etc.). Not only can professional people solve many problems of unprofessionals, professional information circulation and acquisition between professionals is faster, and in terms of hobbies, users can easily find the companion that resonates with their interest preferences, and come together better. The overall communication of all professional information is more professional and more efficient.
